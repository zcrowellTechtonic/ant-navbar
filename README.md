# Ant Design Responsive Menu

This repository complements a [blog post](https://tomas.piestansky.cz/posts/2018/responsive-menu-ant-design/).

A simple example of how to quickly and easily implement a responsive navigation in Ant Design.

## A few notes:
* I have not included [babel-import-plugin](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import) to keep things as simple as possible, consider setting up this plugin when aiming for production.
* React Router is not a requirement, you can essentially use `window.location.pathname` [ref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location) for the `activeLinkKey` prop.
